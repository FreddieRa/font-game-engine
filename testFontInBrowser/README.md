# Test

This is a small web page to test your font.
Assumes you already built your font, and that it is saved in ${projectRoot}/output/out.otf

## Running:

```
node host.js
```

or 
```
npm run host

```

This should open web page to test at http://localhost:3533

## Build


```
tsc && rollup --config rollup.config.js
```

## Note about the cache

Host.js should set the cache control to "no-store", so the browser
*should* not cache the font.

If you keep reloading the page and nothing changes, try emptying the cache.
On chrome:

1.  Open dev tools (ctrl+shift+I). (Ignore the window that pops up, it just needs to be open)
2.  In the browser window, (not the devTools window). Hold left mouse on the reload icon (looks like â†»)
3.  In the menu that pops up select: Empty Cache and Hard Reload
